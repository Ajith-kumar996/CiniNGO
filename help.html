          <p style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 18px; color: rgb(246,163,26,1);">For just 15,000 rupees to cover a 33 month period, you can be linked to a mother and her child and see the difference your donation makes, not only to their lives but to the lives of others in their community.</p>
          <p style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 18px;">The Adopt a Mother and Save her Child project concentrates on nine months of pregnancy and the first two years of a childâ€™s life, during which time, proper nutrition is particularly critical. CINI believes that the most effective way to give a child, born into a poor family, the best possible start in life, is through its mother; nobody is going to take better care of her unborn child or her infant, but she needs to be given the right support. Your donation can help provide that support in the form of nutritional advice, ante and post-natal care, and improved access to government facilities like hospitals for institutional deliveries and child vaccination programmes. These are all crucial factors in ensuring a safe pregnancy and delivery for the mother and a healthy start in life for her child.</p>

          <h2 style="font-family: trebuchet MS; color: #751c1c;">Educate a Child</h2>
          <p style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 18px; color: rgb(246,163,26,1);">For a donation of 8000 rupees, you can support a child in education over a two year period. The Educate a Child programme concentrates on children aged from 5 to 16 years in deprived urban areas. It focuses on getting children into education and keeping them there.</p>
          <p style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 18px;">Street children, children without parents, children of sex workers and children from the slums need to have an environment conducive to learning. The money you give will be used for school fees, uniforms and educational materials.Similar to the Adopt a Mother programme, you are linked to a particular child and will receive three reports about his or her progress over the two year period: first, some background information about the child; then a drawing by the child after 1 year; and finally, a report at the end of the programme.</p>
