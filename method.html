          <p style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 20px;">A Child Friendly Community (CFC) is a community (a rural village or an urban neighbourhood)where all children up to 18 years of age, irrespective of their socio-economic, cultural, gender, ability or other status, can fulfill their rights to survive and be healthy, develop to their full potential, be protected and cared for and participate in decision-making processes shaping their lives. In a CFC, children along with other duty bearers (local self-government, service providers and adult community groups) participate actively in achieving their rights to Education,Protection, Health and Nutrition(EPHN) – and take the responsibility that comes with such entitlements.  They are equal participants in the local governance system along with adult partners, who support them in achieving their goals. A child-centered process facilitates convergent action by different sectors in achieving the well-being of children. Within the framework of CFC, creation of safety net is the priority strategic focus, which enables the local level committees to take proactive role in protecting the rights of their children and giving them a safe environment.</p>

          <p style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 20px;">Poverty is perhaps the worst form of violence against children. In a country where 40 per cent of the population is poor, vulnerability to various forms of deprivation potentially affects almost one in two children.The number of children involved in work that seriously jeopardize their education and adequate development is unknown, but estimates range from 12.6 million (Census 2001), to 60-115 million, as claimed by civil society organisations.Children are victims of abuse, exploitation, neglect and violence within their own families, schools and communities. Child trafficking is an especially serious problem in West Bengal. Duped by traffickers, families give up their children on false promises of job, education and marriage opportunities away from the village. Trafficked children normally end up in the worst forms of exploitation, such as sex work, pornography, domestic labour.</p>

          <h1 style="font-family: verdana; color: #751c1c;">Health</h1>
          <p style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 20px;">In India, only 61% of children between 12-23 m onths are fully immunised against the six major preventable diseases (Coverage Evaluation Survey 2009). Nearly 70% of children under 5 years of age suffer from anaemia. Only 51% of women undergo at least three ante natal care visits. Less than 40 percent of births take place in health facilities. (NFHS 3, 2005-2006).As India’s investments in health have been growing over the past decade and the National Health Mission has been seeking to expand availability of healthcare, the main challenge remains to ensure access in service utilisation by all, especially the poor. CINI works at the family, community, institutional and government levels to bridge the gap between service providers and service users. It helps deprived communities acquire information, knowledge and capacity to access healthcare services. In parallel, CINI trains health service providers, such as government frontline community health ASHA workers, to act as effective healthcare agents as mandated by the National Health Mission, which has entrusted CINI to function as the West Bengal State Nodal Agency (SNA)</p>
